Our project represents an opportunity for us to apply the theoretical concepts we have learned in class to real-world problems. We are committed to producing a high-quality product that not only meets our professor's requirements but also demonstrates our passion for computer science. We are a group of passionate computer science students working together on a class project. Our team is comprised of individuals with diverse backgrounds, skill sets, and interests, but we all share a common goal: to develop an innovative solution that will make a difference in the UH community.

## Goals
The primary objective of Club Hub is to streamline the management of clubs and organizations within a university or college. Our software engineering team aims to develop a centralized platform that will enable students to connect with each other, join or create clubs, and manage all the relevant activities with ease. With Club Hub, we aim to empower the students to take charge of their extracurricular activities and enhance their overall college experience.

    <p style="margin: 0;">"I found the club hub website to be very helpful in finding clubs to join at UH. However, I do wish there was a search function to make it easier to find specific clubs. Although simple in its functionality, it serves its purpose a hub page for students to learn more about the clubs available at UH."</p>

    <p style="margin: 0;">"I have mixed feelings about the club hub website. On one hand, it's great to have a centralized location to view all the different clubs at UH. However, I do find the site to be a bit overwhelming because there are so many clubs listed and you can only filter by one type. Overall, a decent resource for finding clubs, but could be improved." </p>

## State Of Project
Our team of software engineering students has been working diligently on the development of Club Hub. We are currently in the beta testing phase, and we are actively seeking feedback from users to make improvements to the platform. We have successfully implemented the core features of the application, including club creation, event management, and communication tools. We are continuously working to enhance the user experience and to add new features to make Club Hub the ultimate platform for managing clubs and organizations. Stay tuned for updates as we continue to refine and improve the application.

## Development History

## Milestone 1

[Milestone 1](https://github.com/orgs/mongo-mongoers/projects/1)

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system.

![Mockup Page](images/m1Mockup.png)

## Milestone 2

[Milestone 2](https://github.com/orgs/mongo-mongoers/projects/2)

The goal of Milestone 2 was to implement dynamic functionalities to the mockup pages by routing them to the database. We are also added more UH clubs to the database, implemented an officer role, and the ability for admins and officers CRUD functionality to the events page.

![Mockup Page](images/m2ProjectBoard.png)

## Milestone 3

[Milestone 3](https://github.com/orgs/mongo-mongoers/projects/3)

The goal of Milestone 3 is to polish up our already existing features. We will remove all the bowfolios boiler plate code. Fix some small CSS bugs, and add images to each club that we added to the database.
